    <h2>NGRX Store: Actions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Actions = User Events, Backend Events, Device Events</li>
        <li>Actions = breadcrumbs of what has happened</li>
        <li>Actions describe unique events that happen throughout your application and are dispatched from components and services.</li>
        <li>Actions help you to understand how events are handled in your application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>NGRX Store: Actions</h2>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <pre><code data-trim class="typescript">
    {
        type: '[Login Page] Login',
        payload: {
            username: string;
            password: string;
        }
    }
    </code></pre>
    <p>This action describes an event triggered by a user clicking a login button from the login page (=source) to attempt to authenticate a user (=event). The payload contains the username and password provided from the login page.</p>
    <aside class="notes">
        <ul>
            <li>The type property is for describing the action that will be dispatched in your application.</li>
            <li>type: [Source] Event</li>
            <li>Source = provide a context of what category of action it is, and where an action was dispatched from</li>
            <li>Payload = any associated data needed for the action added as properties</li>
        </ul>
    </aside>

    <h2>NGRX Store: Actions</h2>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <pre><code data-trim class="typescript">
        // login.action.ts
        import { Action } from '@ngrx/store';

        export class Login implements Action {
            readonly type = '[Login Page] Login';
        
            constructor(public payload: {
                username: string;
                password: string
            }) {}
        }
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code data-trim class="typescript">
        // login.comonent.ts
        store.dispatch(new Login({
            username: 'myemail@email.de',
            password: 'test'
        }));
    </code></pre>
    <aside class="notes">
        <ul>
            <li>Action = Class for type-safe construction of an action when it's being dispatched.</li>
            <li>The Login action implements the Action interface.</li>
            <li>The payload is an object of a username and password, that is additional metadata needed for the handling of the login action.</li>
            <li>When dispatching instantiate a new instance of the action to use.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Good Actions Writing Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Upfront - write actions before developing features</li>
        <li>Divide - categorize actions based on the event source</li>
        <li>Many - the more and clearer actions you write, the better you express flows in your application</li>
        <li>Event-Driven - capture events as you are separating the description of an event and the handling of that event</li>
        <li>Descriptive - provide context that are targeted to a unique event with more detailed information</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <ul>
            <li>upfront: To understand and gain a shared knowledge of the feature being implemented</li>
            <li>divide: When Source is coming from the backend add API suffic "[Auth API]" or coming from a component add Component suffix "[Auth Component]" or coming from a page add Page suffix "[Login Page]"</li>
            <li>many: Actions are inexpensive to write</li>
            <li>event-driven: Actions are no commands</li>
            <li>descriptive: You can use actions to aid in debugging with the developer tools and get a good insight how the applicatio works</li>
        </ul>
