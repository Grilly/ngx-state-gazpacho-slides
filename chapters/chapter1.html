        <p>how can we observe a change of an attribute?</p>
        <p>Motivation</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our frontend code must manage more state than ever before.</li>
            <li>This state can include server responses, cached data, locally created data that has not yet been persisted to the server</li>
            <li>UI state is also increasing in complexity: We need to manage active routes, selected tabs, spinners, pagination controls,...</li>
            <li>Managing this ever-changing state is hard. If a model can update another model, then a view can update a model, which updates another model, and this, in turn, might cause another view to update</li>
            <li>As developers, we are expected to handle optimistic updates, server-side rendering, fetching data before performing route transitions.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Why to use Redux?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>State management becomes maintainable</li>
        <li>Redux gives us out of the box:
            <ul>
                <li>Logging</li>
                <li>Hot Reloading</li>
                <li>Time Travel</li>
                <li>Universal Apps</li>
                <li>Record & Replay</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Has a great developer experience</li>
        <li>Easy to test</li>

    <h2>When to use Redux?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple independent actors mutate the application data concurrently.</li>
        <li>Components are dependent on each other at completely different parts in the component tree.</li>
        <li>Components that pass data deep down the tree, and react to events several levels up the component tree.</li>
        <li>Sibling components in the tree that are interdependent, and that represent different views for the same data on the screen.</li>
        <li>Only passing data to components through inputs won't scale in complexity.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <ul>
            <li>actors = server & end-user</li>
            <li>dependent components: TODO</li>
            <li>comp pass deep and react up the tree: TODO</li>
            <li>interdependent sibling components: list of folders with unread messages and a total unread messages counter on the page header</li>

            <li>Go to the bank with an Action in mind = { type: "[BANK COUNTER] WITHDRAW MONEY", amount: "10000€" } -> State is readonly (only Cashier can give you money) -> If something changed, we know why it changed.</li>
            <li>The Cashier is to the bank what the Reducer is to Redux: The Reducer gets the state and the action and returns the new state. You dispatch the Action to the reducer.

    <h2>What is Redux: STORE</h2>
    <p>your app’s state is described as a plain object</p>
    <p>State of TODO app</p>
    <pre><code>
    {
        todos: [{
            text: 'Eat food',
            completed: true
        }, {

    <p>No arbitrary model changes</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Redux Action</h2>
    <p>To change something in the state, you need to dispatch an action.</p>
    <p>An action is a plain JavaScript object</p>
    <pre><code>
        { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Go to swimming pool' }
        { type: 'TOGGLE_TODO', index: 1 }
        { type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter: 'SHOW_ALL' }

    <h2>Redux Reducer</h2>
    <p>Reducer function ties state and actions together</p>
    <p>function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the app</p>
    <p>Usually multiple smaller reducers that manage parts of the app and one that manages the smaller reducers</p>
    <p>see https://redux.js.org/introduction/coreconcepts for examples</p>

    <h2>3 Principles of Redux</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Single source of truth</li>
        <li>State is read-only</li>
        <li>Changes are made with pure functions</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="notes">
        <ol>
            <li>The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. => This makes it easy to create universal apps, as the state from your server can be serialized and hydrated into the client with no extra coding effort. A single state tree also makes it easier to debug or inspect an application; it also enables you to persist your app's state in development, for a faster development cycle. Some functionality which has been traditionally difficult to implement - Undo/Redo, for example - can suddenly become trivial to implement, if all of your state is stored in a single tree.</li>
            <li>The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. => This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state. Instead, they express an intent to transform the state. Because all changes are centralized and happen one by one in a strict order, there are no subtle race conditions to watch out for. As actions are just plain objects, they can be logged, serialized, stored, and later replayed for debugging or testing purposes.</li>
            <li>To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers. => Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state. Remember to return new state objects, instead of mutating the previous state. You can start with a single reducer, and as your app grows, split it off into smaller reducers that manage specific parts of the state tree. Because reducers are just functions, you can control the order in which they are called, pass additional data, or even make reusable reducers for common tasks such as pagination.</li>
